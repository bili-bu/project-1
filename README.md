# project-1: **Princess Peach avoids her friends**

## Overview

This was my first project during my time training at the General Assembly bootcamp. 

The task was to build a grid-based computer game that rendered in a browser. This project was front-end only and as such we used HTML and CSS as well as plain ‘vanilla’ JavaScript to build out the game. It was important

We were given many options and I decided to recreate the cult classic frogger. To give it a bit of an unusual twist, I thought it would be fun to delve into the Super Mario universe for characters and style. 

## The brief

* Render a game in the browser
* Design logic for winning & visually display which player won
* Stick with **KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)** and **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles
* Use **Javascript** for **DOM manipulation**
* **Deploy your game online**, where the rest of the world can access it

## Technologies used

* HTML5
*	CSS3
*	JavaScript
*	Git
*	GitHub
*	Google Fonts
